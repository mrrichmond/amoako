Computers are still much less useful than the ability of the human eye for
pattern matching. This ability can be used quite straightforwardly to identify structure
in a data set when it is two or three dimensional. With data sets with more than 3
dimensions some kind of transformation is always necessary. In this paper we review in
depth and present and extension of one of these mechanisms: Andrews' curves. With
the Andrews' curves we use a curve to represent each data point. A human can run
his eye along a set of curves (representing the members of the data set) and identify
particular regions of the curves which are optimal for identifying clusters in the data
set. Of interest in this context, is our extension in which a moving three-dimensional
image is created in which we can see clouds of data points moving as we move along
the curves; in a very real sense, the data which dance together are members of the
same cluster.
